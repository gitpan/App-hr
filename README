FUNCTIONS
  hr([CHAR]) => optional STR
    Print (under void context) or return (under scalar/array context) a
    horizontal ruler with the width of the terminal.

    "CHAR" is optional, can be multicharacter, but cannot be empty string.
    The defautl is "=".

    Under Windows, when printing, will shave one character at the end
    because the terminal cursor will move a line down when printing at the
    last column.

    Terminal width is currently determined using Term::App::Role::Attrs,
    which will either use environment variable "COLUMNS" or detecting using
    Term::Size, or if all those fail, use a hard-coded default of 80.
